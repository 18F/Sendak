Planning for the future
====

The code is supposed to be largely [orthogonal](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2078767/open-source-tools/java-tip-orthogonality-by-example.html)
(apologies for Java reference) so that the back-ends can change while the
interfaces remain the same and code-churn is reduced. Additionally the
highly-segregated nature of the software makes inter-language operation
(as so far we have shell, javascript, and python; I am almost certain later
I will get lazy and there will be perl pieces) development not just possible, 
but pretty easy.

Patches welcome, et cetera.
